🛒 Retail Sales Analysis using SQL
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using SQL to uncover meaningful business insights. I designed structured tables, performed advanced queries, and applied analytical SQL techniques such as joins, aggregations, window functions, and ranking to solve real-world retail business problems.

The goal was to transform raw transactional data into actionable insights that can help businesses improve decision-making related to sales performance, customer behavior, and loyalty programs.

🎯 Business Problem Solved

Retail businesses often struggle to:

Identify top-performing products and customers

Understand customer demographics and purchasing behavior

Measure the effectiveness of loyalty programs

Track city-wise and category-wise sales performance

This project solves these challenges by delivering clear, data-driven answers that support:

Revenue optimization

Customer segmentation

Strategic marketing decisions

Inventory and pricing optimization

🗂️ Database Design

I created and worked with two core tables:

1️⃣ RetailSales

Stores transactional-level sales data including:

Customer demographics (age, gender)

Product categories

Quantity sold

Pricing and total sales amount

2️⃣ customer_details

Stores customer metadata such as:

City

Loyalty points

Customer identification

These tables were joined to perform multi-dimensional analysis across customers, cities, and products.
